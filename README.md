This repository contains the completed work for the MSCS-634-M40 Lab 1 assignment. The lab focuses on applying data visualization, preprocessing, and statistical analysis techniques using Python in a Jupyter Notebook environment. The dataset used, "Education_Costs.csv", includes information on education costs across various countries, such as tuition fees, living costs, and visa fees for master's programs. The goal of this lab was to explore, clean, and analyze this dataset through a series of structured steps.

The main file in this repository is "shaffan_Lab1.ipynb", a Jupyter Notebook that walks through all the required steps of the lab. It starts with loading the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame and displaying the first five rows, followed by creating visualizations like bar charts and box plots to explore relationships and distributions in the data. The notebook then covers data preprocessing tasks, including handling missing values, outlier detection using IQR, data reduction through sampling and column elimination, and scaling/discretization of numerical columns. Finally, it performs statistical analysis, calculating measures like central tendency, dispersion, and correlation matrices for numerical columns. Screenshots of key outputs, such as visualizations, preprocessed datasets, and statistical results, are included in the "screenshots" folder to document the process and findings.

To run the notebook, ensure you have Python 3 installed along with the required libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn. You can install these dependencies using pip (e.g., pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn). Place the "Education_Costs.csv" file in the same directory as the notebook, then open "shaffan_Lab1.ipynb" in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab and execute the cells in order. The notebook is well-documented with Markdown cells explaining each step, and the code is written to handle potential errors, such as selecting only numerical columns for correlation analysis to avoid issues with string data.
